# XsdParser

XsdParser is a library that parses a XML Definition file (.xsd) into a list of java objects. Each different tag has a corresponding java object and its attributes are represented as fields in java. 
All java objects follow the definition of the xsd rules and enforces them, which means that if a xsd file has an element containing a child that isn't supposed to it will ignore that child. 

The rules for the xsd schema are present in the following URL:

http://www.datypic.com/sc/xsd/s-xmlschema.xsd.html 

## Installation

First, in order to include it to your Maven project, simply add this dependency:

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.xmlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>xsdParser</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.6</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage example

Here follows a simple example where we want to obtain all the top level xsd:element objects parsed.

``` java
public class ParserApp {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        String filePath = "Your file path here.";
        XsdParser parserInstance = new XsdParser();

        List<XsdElement> elements = parserInstance.parse(filePath)
                .filter(element -> element instanceof XsdElement)
                .map(element -> (XsdElement) element)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

If the parsed file were to contain the following xml:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
<xsd:schema xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/intellisense/html-5' xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
	
	<xsd:group name="flowContent">
	    <xsd:all>
	        <xsd:element name="elem1"/>
            </xsd:all>
	</xsd:group>
	
	<xs:element name="html">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xsd:choice>
                    <xsd:group ref="flowContent"/>
                </xsd:choice>
			    <xs:attribute name="manifest" type="xsd:anyURI" />
            </xs:complexType>
	</xs:element>
</xsd:schema>
```

The result could be consulted in the following way:


``` java
public static void main(String [] args) {
    (...)
            
    XsdElement htmlElement = elements.get(0);

    XsdComplexType htmlComplexType = htmlElement.getXsdComplexType();
    List<XsdAttribute> htmlAttributeList = htmlComplexType.getXsdAttributes().collect(Collectors.toList());

    XsdAttribute manifestAttribute = htmlAttributeList.get(0);

    XsdChoice choiceElement = (XsdChoice) htmlComplexType.getXsdChildElement();

    List<XsdAbstractElement> choiceChildren = choiceElement.getXsdElements().collect(Collectors.toList());

    XsdGroup flowContentGroup = (XsdGroup) choiceChildren.get(0);

    XsdAll flowContentAll = (XsdAll) flowContentGroup.getChildElement();

    List<XsdAbstractElement> groupMembers = flowContentAll.getXsdElements().collect(Collectors.toList());

    XsdElement elem1 = (XsdElement) groupMembers.get(0);
}
```

### Reference solving

This is a big feature of this library. In XSD files the usage os the ref attribute is frequent, in order to avoid repetition of xml code. 
This generates two problems when handling the parsing which are detailed below.

#### Missing ref elements

The referenced element does not exist. Even though it should not happen, it might. In order to deal with this problem there were created wrappers to all elements.

UnsolvedElement - A wrapper to all elements that were not found in the file.  
ConcreteElement - A wrapper to all elements that are present in the document.  
NamedConcreteElement - A wrapper to all elements that are present in the document and have a name attribute present.  
ReferenceBase - A shared interface from which UnsolvedReference and ConcreteElement derive.  

#### Parsing Strategy

In order to minimize the number of passages in the file, which take more time to perform, this library chose to parse all the elements and then resolve the references present. 
This means that after parsing all the elements from the file, those same elements are filtered and obtained all the NamedConcreteElements. Those are the elements that may be 
referenced by UnsolvedReferences. This way, we can compare the name present in the NamedConcreteElement and the ref in the UnsolvedElement. In the case that a match is present a 
deep copy of the element wrapped in the NamedConcreteElement is made and accessing the parent of the element wrapped in UnsolvedElement the changed can be made. 

Short Example:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
<xsd:schema xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/intellisense/html-5' xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
	
    <xsd:group id="replacement" name="flowContent">         <!-- NamedConcreteType wrapping a XsdGroup -->
        (...)
    </xsd:group>
	
    <xsd:choice>                                            <!-- ConcreteElement wrapping a XsdChoice -->
        <xsd:group id="toBeReplaced" ref="flowContent"/>    <!-- UnsolvedReference wrapping a XsdGroup -->
    </xsd:choice>
</xsd:schema>
```

In this short example we have a XsdChoice element with an element XsdGroup with a reference attribute as a child. 
When replacing the UnsolvedReferences the XsdGroup with the ref attribute is going to be replaced by a deep copy of the already parsed
XsdGroup with the name attribute. This is achieved by accessing the parent of the element to be replaced and removing the element to be replaced
and adding the replacement.

### Hierarchy support

The parser supports xsd:base tags, which allow the use of hierarchies in the xsd files. 
The extended xsd:element is referenced in the element containing the xsd:base tag so in order to obtain all the attributes/elements that element has you 
have to iterate on that base field.

## Code Quality

There are some tests available using the HTML5 schema and the Android layouts schema, you can give a look at that examples and tweak them in order to gain a better understanding of how the parsing works.
The tests also cover most of the code, if you are interested in verifying the code quality/vulnerabilities/etc the various metrics are available on:

## Important remarks

xsd:import - XsdParser does not support xsd:import tags, meaning that if there are import tags the content of the imported files should be manually added to the main file. Support for xsd:import tags will be added, when my schedule clears.   
name attribute - XsdParser uses the name attribute as a tool in order to resolve references, therefore it should be unique in the file. Using multiple times the same name will generate unexpected behaviour.
